# Bitter

This project is meant to be a very simple Twitter clone app. It is not meant to be a replacement, it is just a personal exercise in programming.

## Planned features
* Users should upload avatar
* If users do not have custom set avatar, generic avatar should be provided (i.e. 'twitter egg')
* User should be able to make edits to their profile
* Users home page should display first 20 bitters by friends, and have a "load more bitter comments" option, which loads additional 20
* User should have their user page, which displays their own tweets
* Logout/Login/Sign up all the usual stuff features
* Find friends feature, which displays list of peoples, with their usernames, avatars, and bitters/following/followers stats
* Option to delete a bitter comment (a bitter comment or a bitt, is same as a tweet)
* Users should have follow/unfollow feature
* And maybe the public bitts feed

## Status of a project [still in progress]

Make an example folder which contains basic templates for each of the described features.
