# Bitter

This project is meant to be a very simple Twitter clone app. It is not meant to be a replacement, it is just a personal exercise in programming.

## Planned features
* ~~Users should upload avatar~~
* ~~If users do not have custom set avatar, generic avatar should be provided (i.e. 'twitter egg')~~
* ~~User should be able to make edits to their profile~~
* ~~Users home page should display first 20 bitters by friends, and have a "load more bitter comments" option, which loads additional 20~~ (not implemented)
* User should have their user page, which displays their own tweets
* ~~Logout/Login/Sign up all the usual stuff features~~
* ~~Find friends feature, which displays list of peoples, with their usernames, avatars, and bitters/following/followers stats~~ (partially, there is no search option)
* ~~Option to delete a bitter comment (a bitter comment or a bitt, is same as a tweet)~~ (not yet implemented)
* Users should have follow/unfollow feature
* ~~And maybe the public bitts feed~~ (not yet implemented)

## Status of a project [still in progress]

~~Make an example folder which contains basic templates for each of the described features.~~

When one clicks on a profile, instead of a bitt box, there should be a follow button. If a user is a friend, then no button or bitt box should be displayed. Or maybe, an unfollow button should be displayed instead.

Add relevant error messages.
